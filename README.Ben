These files are for the investigation of Scott Epstein's new deltaHvap parameterizations.

CAMx.delH.121508 - code with Hvap improvements made to soap.f.   Comments are included for tracking down timing and errors.

CAMx.delH.121508 - code with no comments.

CAMx.delH.122308.fast - code with open and read statements moved to readchm.f routine.  This should take the slowest part of the algorithm (opening, reading and closing input files) out of the converging loops and speed up the algorithm substantially.
