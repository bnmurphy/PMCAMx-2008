1. IEHSOLV - modified the error tolerance for LSODE to 
adaptively tighten in cases where LSODE fails to converge  
and a tighter error tolerance may correct the problem.

2. Added fine grid source area maps

3. Fixed code that calculates the cell index of a point inside
of a nest.

4. Added IRON PiG (NOT YET!!!)

5. Added Reactive Tracer (RTRAC) source apportionment type.

6. Removed smolar

7. Receptor file now has grid number.

8. Added code to handle episode that goes over new year.

9. Put error catch when PiG is on but point sources is off.

10. Added y2k flag to a couple of routines in which it was needed

11. Added new wet dep routine for gases and PM

12. Added aqueous PM chemistry to mechanism 4

13. Added ISOROPIA to mechanism 4

14. Added SOA algorithm to mechanism 4

15. Cloud and rain files now combined into a single file; 
    Cloud/rain files can now be supplied for all grids.
    Cloud/rain files revamped for resolved-only cloud water, precip water,
    and optical depth

16. Changed H2 and CH4 from mixing ratio to ppm in CHEMDRIV and IRONCHEM

17. Species list modified to split OC -> (POA, SOA1-4), COC -> (CG1-4),
    PFIN -> (FCRS, FPRM), PCRS -> (CCRS, CPRM)

18. Added deposition output file.

19. UTMGEO now works for SH when supplied negative zone number.

20. Mech 4 gas-phase chemistry updated to Mech 3.

21. All aerosol species carried internally in native ug/m3 units.

22. Spurious old CB-IV heterogeneous SO2 -> Sulf reaction removed, gas-phase
    SO2 -> Sulf reaction rate updated (Change to chemparam files, not CAMx),
    N2O5 + H2O reaction rate reduced to SAPRC99 rate in mechanism 4.

23. Better error messages in AHOPREP, increased max columns in read of
    albedo/haze codes from from 999 to 9999, fixed bug in READAHO when 
    rewinding and reading again from top
 
24. Changed the drought stress adjustment in vd_gas to be more reallistic,
    users can now specify a scaling factor for Rs in chemparam file (to zero
    Rs for strong acids), Ra calculation revised to scale from layer 1 midpoint
    rather than hard-wired 10 m.  Dry dep velocity set to zero for gas species
    w/ H-law values < 1e-6.

25. Added CPA process anlysis for mech 5, added flag lcpacum set in PASETUP
    to allow CPA variables to be cumulative (toy for Gail)

26. Removed max timestep from input control file -- it's now a parameter set
    in timestep.f (currently 900 s).

27. Removed UAM-V type cloud file inputs and photolysis adjustment.

28. Timesteps for each grid are now layer-dependent for horizontal advection.
