SOFTWARE LICENSE AGREEMENT

THIS LICENSE AGREEMENT ("Agreement") is by and between the recipient of the CAMx
computer software program ("Software") and APBI ENVIRONmental Sciences Group, 
Inc., d/b/a ENVIRON International Corporation ("ENVIRON"), a Virginia corporation 
having its principal place of business at 4350 North Fairfax Drive, Arlington, 
Virginia 22203.  This Agreement is made effective as of the date ("Effective Date") 
that the Software is delivered to the Licensee either electronically (i.e., 
accessed through a bulletin board or the Internet) or directly from ENVIRON.


1.   LICENSE

     A.   License Grant.  ENVIRON grants Licensee a perpetual, nonexclusive 
          license to use the CAMx computer software program, version 4.02.

     B.   Scope.  It is ENVIRON's belief that any type of computer software 
          used in regulatory settings should be publicly available at zero 
          cost to all entities in the regulator/regulated communities.  As 
          such, Licensee may use the Software in any manner, with the following 
          limitation: (i) derivative works based in whole or in part on the 
          Software computer code must be made publicly available at zero cost
          to all entities in the regulatory/regulated communities.  If Licensee 
          allows the Software to be accessed through a bulletin board, the 
          Internet or any other "shareware" distribution process, Licensee 
          is required to transmit this Agreement along with the Software.

     C.   Ownership.  This Agreement does not provide Licensee with any title 
          or ownership interest in the Software, but only with a right of 
          limited use in accordance with this Agreement.  Licensee acknowledges 
          that ENVIRON owns all rights, title and interest in the Software, 
          its accompanying User Manual (the "Manual"), and the intellectual 
          property inherent therein, including all patent, copyright, trademark, 
          trade secret, know-how, or other rights under U.S. or foreign law or 
          international treaty regime.

     D.   No Installation, Training, Support or Updates. This Agreement does not 
          include any professional or consulting services in connection with 
          ENVIRON's provision of the Software.  All training, assistance, 
          installation and/or product support may be provided, at ENVIRON's 
          discretion, on a time-and-materials basis at ENVIRON's then current 
          rates under the terms and conditions of a separate arrangement.  ENVIRON
          shall not provide support, consultation or other maintenance services 
          for the Software.

     E.   Material Terms.  All terms and conditions of this Agreement are material 
          terms of the license granted by this Agreement.

          purposes. Furthermore, Licensee may develop new computer code derived 
          in whole or in part on the Software and may distribute the derivative 
          work with the stipulation set forth in Section 1.B.i above.  Licensee 
          agrees to reproduce and include ENVIRON's copyright, trademark, and 
          other proprietary rights notices on any modified Software or Manual 
          and or any derivative work.  All of the terms and conditions in this

          from using the Software and that ENVIRON does not warrant that the 
          Software will meet Licensee's specific needs or requirements.

     C.   Disclaimer.  THE FOREGOING WARRANTIES ARE IN LIEU OF ALL
          OTHER WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT

5.   GENERAL

     A.   Entire Agreement.  This Agreement (including any Exhibits referred 
          to herein and attached hereto) contains the entire agreement of the 
          parties and supersedes all prior agreements and representations, 
          whether written or oral, with respect to the subject matter of this 
          Agreement.  Modification or amendment of this Agreement, or any part 
          of this Agreement, may be made only by a written instrument executed
          by both Parties.

     B.   Assignment.  Neither this Agreement nor Licensee's obligations thereunder, 
          shall be assigned or delegated by Licensee, by law or otherwise, without 
          the prior express written consent by ENVIRON.  Any purported assignment 
          or delegation in violation of this Section 5.B shall be null and void.  
          ENVIRON may, at its sole discretion, assign this Agreement, in whole or 
          in part, to any third party.

     C.   Governing Law and Dispute Resolution.  This Agreement shall be governed 
          by and construed in accordance with the laws of the Commonwealth of 
          Virginia notwithstanding any Virginia choice of law rules that would 
          apply the substantive law of any other jurisdiction or venue. Any 
          disputes arising out of or relating to this Agreement shall be settled 
          in the courts of the Commonwealth of Virginia, whose judgment may be 
          enforced by any court having jurisdiction over the parties or their 
          assets.  The Licensee hereby irrevocably consents and waives all
          objections to the jurisdiction of such court on any grounds, including 
          lack of personal jurisdiction, improper venue, and forum non conveniens.

     D.   Severability.  If any provision of this Agreement is held invalid by a 
          court with jurisdiction over the parties to this Agreement, then such 
          provision shall be deemed to be restated to reflect as nearly as 
          possible the original intentions of the parties in accordance with 
          applicable law, and the remainder of this Agreement shall continue in 
          effect as if the Agreement had been entered into without the invalid 
          portion.

     E.   Notice.   All notices, requests and demands, other than routine 
          communications under this Agreement, shall be in writing and shall be 
          deemed to have been duly given when delivered, or when transmitted, to 
          the designated representative of the other party: 
          (I)  by hand; 
          (II) by confirmed facsimile (with a copy provided by another means 
               specified in this Subsection); (iii) one (1) business day after 
               being given to an overnight courier with a reliable system for 
               tracking delivery, or 
          (IV) three (3) business days after the day of mailing, when mailed 
               by United States mail, registered or certified mail, return 
               receipt requested, postage prepaid.

     F.   Headings.  The section headings in this Agreement are intended to be 
          for reference purposes only and shall in no way be construed to modify 
          or restrict any of the terms or provisions of this Agreement.


By accepting delivery of the Software, either electronically or in any other 
fashion, Licensee acknowledges that it has read this Agreement, understands 
it and intends to be legally bound by this Agreement.
