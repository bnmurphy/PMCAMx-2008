rateslo5.f - SAPRC rates file currently in use
rateslo5b.f - Base Case (ro=1.0 g/cm3), SOA aging turned off
rateslo5c.f - ro=1.5 g/cm3, SOA aging off
rateslo5d.f - ro=1.5 g/cm3, SOA aging turned ON

rateslo5e.f - ro=1.5 g/cm3, noNO3, SOA aging off
rateslo5g.f - ro=1.5 g/cm3, ASOA aging on, BSOA aging off
rateslo5f.f - ro=1.5 g/cm3, ASOA aging on, BSOA aging off, Lea's new toluene yields
rateslo5h.f - rho=1.0 (put density change into soap module). No rxns are commented (commenting done in rxnrate.f from now on). Lea's Toluene yields implemented.


rxnrate5a.f - all aging rxns turned on
rxnrate5b.f - base case, BSOA aging turned off
rxnrate5c.f - SOA aging turned off

radslvr5_SAPRC.f  - default radical chemistry solver. NO3 radical is unstable
radslvr5_NO3.f - Vlassis version.  Uses Hertel's method to solve NO3-N2O5 system/
radslvr5_BenNO3.f - BNM version.  Uses Hertel's eqn but includes r(12) in gain for NO3 because I think it should be there.
